<h1>Impractical Jokers Meme Creater</h1>
<br><br>
My submission to <b>Impractical Hackers</b> Hackathon on 5th-7th Feb'21 weekend.

<h2>Design of the Website</h2>
<p>
  <b><i>A completely Responsive design for each and every Device</i></b><br><br>
  The <b>Homepage</b> of the website is set to a minimilastic scene, focussing on the task done by the website and avoiding any uneccessary directions. I uesd Horizontal Scrolling as I felt it would further simplify the website's UX. The presence of a nav bar on the bottom of the screen also aims to smoothen the <i>navigation</i> as pages snap into view. The meme creater application itself is very simple, with a clean gallery present along it to activate the user's creatvity. The <b>Footer</b>. of the website is an entire page at the end. The user has the choice to share the website to their Twitter and Facebook pages.

<h2>The Meme Creator Application</h2>
<p>
  A Canvas element houses the picture that is selected by the user. By default a picture is already present in the canvas, which can be replaced by an array of 6(more coming soon) pictures. The Headline input allows printing of text on the image. There is a limit to the maximum number of words. The **Generate Link** button below the canvas element creates a link to the meme created by the user. The link can be opened to save the meme created. Coming Soon: A way to share the picture created directly to a socila media website.
